# Web Development Project 3 - *World Capitals Flashcards*

Submitted by: **Tarina Muna**

This web app: **The "World Capitals Flashcards" is an interactive quiz app featuring 59 flashcards, each displaying the name of a country's capital. It allows users to navigate through the cards using "Next" and "Back" buttons and offers a "Shuffle" button to randomize the order. Users can guess the capital of a given country by typing their answer into an input field and submitting it. If the guess is correct, a "Correct" message is shown, while an incorrect guess prompts the user to try again until they get it right.**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Notes

One challenge encountered while building the "World Capitals Flashcards" app was ensuring the user input validation worked correctly for both correct and incorrect answers. It required fine-tuning the logic to allow multiple guesses and displaying the appropriate feedback without disrupting the flow of the game.
